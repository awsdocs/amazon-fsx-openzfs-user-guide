Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file systems automatically encrypt data in transit when they are accessed from Amazon EC2 instances that support encryption in transit\. For more information about which EC2 instances support encryption in transit, see [Encryption in transit](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/data-protection.html#encryption-transit) in the *Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances*\. In\-transit encryption of data is available in all AWS Regions where Amazon FSx for OpenZFS is available\.
